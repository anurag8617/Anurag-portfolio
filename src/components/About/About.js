            Hi, I'm Anurag, a passionate and dedicated Full-Stack Web Developer
            from West Bengal, India. I recently completed my Bachelor of
            Computer Applications (BCA) and have been working on real-world web
            development projects to sharpen my skills and build practical
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in MERN stack development (MongoDB, Express.js,
            React.js, Node.js) and have hands-on experience in creating
            responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications. Iâ€™ve worked
            on projects like Inventory Management Systems, Pathology Lab
            Websites, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love writing clean, efficient code and continuously learning new
            technologies to improve my craft. My goal is to build solutions that
            not only look good but also solve real-world problems.
